The source contains a number of projects written in various languages, that I have created over a number of years. I will eventually separate out active projects and create new relevant repositories.

- RepoBuzz\dotnet contains a c# dnn artificial implementation, that actually works. This project is still under constructions and contains a lot of brain farts. So sorry for the mess.

- RepoBuzz\python contains a python keras/tensorflow implementation of the same dnn implemented in the dotnet version. This has been created to compare the two approaches. This keras/tensorflow approach is of course a LOT faster even when only running on the cpu

- RepoBuzz\data contains sample data that can be used to train and validate the two dnn implementations.

- RepoBuzz\hashcode_2019 and RepoBuzz\hashcode_practice contain source code related to Google's HashCode 2019 challenge. The sources have been created in colaboration with https://github.com/Sinitax (so a huge Thanks to sinitax). I have created a related github repository HashCode2019 which contains code, that only my poor litle brain came up with.

- RepoBuzz\cpp\project01 contain something really old in relation. A Win32 game of life presentation that uses the RGB color channels as competing entities/cells. It is quite prety. Has been implemented with VS 6 using very old win32 Windows programming...well I have even older code than this...
